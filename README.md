Contains the MNIST dataset with several classifiers applied. The MNIST dataset is first extracted from the original website. HOG (histogram of oriented gradients) was then applied to the features for the feature engineering process. Then we'll use KNN, SVM and neural network to test the accuracy of each classifier.
